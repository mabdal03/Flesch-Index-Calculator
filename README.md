The Flesch Index calculator is a calculator that takes a file with text
as input and returns the Flesch Index readability score. This score is essentially
the measure of how difficult a passage in English is to understand. 

You can find more information on the Flesch Index at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests
