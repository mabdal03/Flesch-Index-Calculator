# Flesch-Index-Calculator

The Flesch Index calculator is a calculator that takes a file with text
as input and returns the Flesch Index readability score. This score is essentially
the measure of how difficult a passage in English is to understand. It can be between [0,100] and the higher the score, the easier the text is to read.

You can find more information on the Flesch Index at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests

You can compile the program by heading to the directory where the files can be found and then type "make" into the WSL command line.
Then, simply type "./main *filename*" There are 3 tests available in the repository you can use to try the program yourself! *test1, test2...*
